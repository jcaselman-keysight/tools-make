# The presence of this file identifies the directory as one in which the
# regression testing framework should attempt to find and run testcases.
# This is sourced by the shell script running the tests and may be used
# to set up the environment variables for the test etc.
# Special variable declarations are used by the regression testing:
# PARALLEL may be used to specify a space separated list of tests to be
# executed concurrently.
# SEQUENCE may be used to specify a space separated list of tests to be
# executed sequentially.
# The SEQUENCE tests are executed before the PARALLEL tests.
# Any occurrence of an asterisk in either variable is expanded to a space
# delimited list of all the available tests in the directory.
# If neither variable is specified the system assumes SEQUENCE="*" so that
# all available tests are executed sequentially.
# Test names may occur more than once, in which case those tests will be
# executed more than once.
